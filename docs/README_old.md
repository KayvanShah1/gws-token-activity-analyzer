# Google Workspace Token Activity Analyzer

A robust data pipeline to **fetch**, **process**, and **analyze** token activity events from the `Google Workspace Admin Reports API`. This project ensures no data loss across multiple runs and provides insight into API usage patterns.

## Overview

This project is designed to:

1. **Fetch** token activity events using `Google Admin SDK Reports API`.
2. **Buffer and persist** these events in *time-partitioned* `JSONL` files.
3. **Process and deduplicate** the events using **Apache Beam** and store them in optimized Parquet format.
4. **Analyze** recent activity (last `48` hours) using **Polars** to answer key questions:
   * Who generated the most events?
   * Which API method returned the most bytes?

### 1. **Fetcher**

* Uses Google's Admin Reports API to retrieve `token` activity events.
* Adds a **3-minute overlap** between runs to avoid data loss due to delays in API event delivery.
* Partitions and stores events by:
  * `YYYY-MM-DD/part_HH.jsonl(.gz)`
* Each fetch run also produces a dedicated `.jsonl(.gz)` file capturing all events retrieved during that run. This file serves as a:
    * Complete snapshot of raw API responses for the run (unfiltered, unpartitioned, and undeduplicated).
    * One file per run, named using `ISO-style UTC` timestamps (e.g., `epr_2025-05-30T15-00-00Z.jsonl.gz`). `epr` stands for `Events per run`.
    * This file is not used in the processing pipeline; it's retained strictly for audit and debugging.

### 2. **Processor**

* Built with **Apache Beam** (DirectRunner).
* Reads compressed raw files from the last 48 hours (based on last-run timestamp).
* Deduplicates records using the `unique_id` field.
* Converts and writes partitioned **Parquet files** (one per day).

### 3. **Analyzer**

* Uses **Polars** for fast DataFrame operations.
* Reads recent Parquet files (last 48 hours).
* Filters events strictly by timestamp.
* Computes:
  * **Top user** by event count.
  * **Top method_name** by total bytes returned.

## Design problems

### How to choose the right minute-overlap (to avoid missing late events)?

**Short answer:** measure real lateness from your own runs, then set overlap to the high-percentile delay plus a small safety pad (e.g., +1–2 min).

**Data-driven, iterative method (N-run approach):**

1. **Run N jobs without overlap** (e.g., hourly, N≈10). Each run *i* queries `[start_i, end_i]` and emits a **per-run** JSONL snapshot (`epr_…jsonl.gz`).
2. For each run *i*, compute:

   * `min_event_i` = min `event_time` in that run’s snapshot
   * `max_event_i` = max `event_time` in that run’s snapshot
3. Compute *clipped* gaps (always non-negative):

   * **early\_gap\_i** = `max(0, start_i - min_event_i)`  → how far **back** late events arrived
   * **late\_gap\_i**  = `max(0, max_event_i - end_i)`   → how far **past** the window events extend
4. Your **backward overlap** should cover late arrivals:

   * `overlap_minutes = ceil( percentile(early_gap, 95) ) + safety_pad_minutes`
   * Use 95–99th percentile for stability; set `safety_pad_minutes` to 1–2.
5. (Optional) If you also want a **forward guard band** (rarely needed), add `ceil(percentile(late_gap, 95))`.

> If you don’t have history yet, use **3–5 minutes**. After a few days, recompute the percentile and tighten/loosen as needed.


## Assumptions & Safeguards

* No real-time guarantees from the API. Events may arrive late or out of order.
* A **time-based overlap** ensures reliable fetching across runs.
* Deduplication is based on `unique_id` to prevent duplicate counting.
* Processing logic is based on **event time**, not fetch time, to align with actual user activity.
* Only events from the **last 48 hours (from last run)** are processed and analyzed.
